          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>Prompts the user to roll 2 six-sided dice with a button click, the result will then be displayed in a styled div for the user to view. 
          The user can continue to reroll dice if they wish. </p>
          <p>Our intended audience would simply be anybody without a pair of dice handy. Do you have a pair on you? </p>
          <p>In lieu of physical dice, our page offers the user randomly generated dice results wrapped in a convenient, user friendly experience. </p>
