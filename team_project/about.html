          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>Whether you're playing a classic board game or just experimenting with probability, having dice on hand is essential. 
            This project was inspired by the need for an accessible dice-rolling solution that eliminates the hassle of carrying physical dice while still ensuring fair and random results.
          </p>

          <p>Our digital dice roller allows users to roll a variety of dice, including four-sided, six-sided, eight-sided, ten-sided, twelve-sided, and twenty-sided options. 
            You can roll up to twelve dice at once, with each individual result and the total sum displayed clearly above the individual images.
          </p>
          <p>This project was created to provide everyone with an accessible way to roll die for any purpose. 
            In lieu of physical dice, our page offers the user randomly generated dice results wrapped in a convenient, user friendly experience. 
          </p>
          <p>As long as dice remain a core part of gaming, our project will stay relevant. 
            What sets our project apart is its simplicity and ease of use. With just a few clicks, users can roll multiple die with various option to choose from.</p>
