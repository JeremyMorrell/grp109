          <h3>Goal Evaluation</h3>
          <p>Goal: Create a dice roller simulator for all - Success! Our project was able to provide functionality for the user, allowing them to roll the dice and meet
            the various needs of their situation. Whether their playing a board game or just want to roll die, this project is there for them!
          </p>

          <p>Goal: Roll multiple die - Almost a success. The user is able to choose from the amount of die they want to roll, from 1 to 12. The only limitation is 
            the amount, as the user is unable to roll more than 12. In situations where they would need more, this part of our website creates a challenge.
            We struggled with making the images of the die look nice and not overcrowded while still being functional, so we were forced to create a limit. If we 
            had more time and expertise, we could've made the size of the die dynamically change based on the amount rolled, allowing for a much larger maximum. 
          </p>
          <p>Goal: Roll a variety of die - Almost a success. The user can choose from multiple different die that they would like to roll, from four-sided to twenty-sided.
            This provides a plethora of flexibility for the user, allowing them to utilize the game for a larger range of needs. However, we didn't implement every single type
            of die, which could limit the usability of our webiste. Nonetheless, we believe that the types that we included will enable more than the majority of users to 
            effecitvely utilzie our webiste, and in order to keep the project reasonable we had to stop the amount of die created at some point.
